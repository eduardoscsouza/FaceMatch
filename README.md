# **FaceMatch**
Final project for **SCC0251/SCC5830 - Image Processing - 1st Semester of 2020** at University of SÃ£o Paulo.

## **Abstract**
This project aims to build a system capable of, given two images, determine if both have the face of the same person or different people in them, known as the face verification problem. It will use image segmentation to separate the faces from the rest of the images, and image classification to determine whether the cropped faces belong to the same person. The images used will be photographic images of people, where their faces are visible, mainly from the WIDER and CelebA datasets. Possible applications revolve around security, where it is needed to verify someone's identity by an image of their face, like unlocking a phone, and many survailence systems.

## **Detailed Description**
This project is aimed at the face verification problem. It is divided in two parts, segmentation and verification.
The segmentation aspect is the main strictly image processing aspect of the project, and consists of generating a bounding boxes of people's faces in an image, and subsequently cropping them.
The verification aspect consists of getting two images of faces, and determining if the faces belong to the same person.
For both aspects of the project, we intend to compare several approches, both classical and deep learning ones, and analyze both accuracy as well as computational costs.

## **Example Images**

*Image 1 - First Image of Michael Jackson*

*Image 2 - Second Image of Michael Jackson*

*Image 3 - Image of Taylor Swift*

The system built by this project should, in all images, be able to crop the faces out of them, and then identify that the first and the sencond belong to the same person, and the third to a different person.
