# FaceMatch

Final project for **SCC0251 - Image Processing** at University of Sao Paulo.

**Abstract:** This project aims to build a system that can compare two different images and verify if both have the face of the same person in them. The main image processing goal will be to segment the images to obtain the faces in it, and to compare several face segmentation methods, both classical ones and deep learning models. Then, the resulting segmented images will be inputed into classification models to verify if they are of the same person.

**Keywords:** Image Segmentation; Feature Learning; Deep Learning; Faces.
